## Assembly Template
Welcome to my x86-64 assembly template. Your main file
is going to be in `main.asm`. Linking and compiling
options are in the `Makefile. `main.asm` is already set
up with a simple "Hello, world!" program, so feel free
to edit that. The debugger is also setup with GDB.

Below are some resources to learn the language:
