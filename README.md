## Assembly Template
Welcome to my x86_64 assembly template. Your main file
is going to be in `main.asm`. Linking and compiling
options are in the `Makefile` (it's a hidden file so
you have to make sure to select `Show hidden files`).
`main.asm` is already set up with a simple "Hello,
World" program, so feel free to edit that. The debugger
is also setup with GDB.

Below are some resources to learn the language:

- [DaCuteRaccoon's Guide to Assembly](DOCS.md)
- [Tutorials Point's assembly PDF](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_tutorial.pdf)
